      Rules
    </h1>
      <ol start="1">
      <li>Start off by choosing your colors and placing the 4 game pieces of your color on the starting area of the board that’s your color. <br/>
      <li>Youngest player goes first, take turns in a clockwise direction. <br/>
      <li>During each turn, players draw cards equal to the number of pieces they have on their spawn. If there are no pieces on your spawn, draw 1 card. <br/>
      <li>During each turn, (after your draw), you can perform up to 3 actions. You cannot “save” actions to perform them on your next turns if you don’t use all of your actions during your current turn. <br/>
      <li>You can decide when to use your action cards although you can only use them during your turn. You do not have a maximum hand size. <br/>
      <li>After using an action card, place the action card at the bottom of the action card deck. <br/>
      <li>If your action card states that you gain power tokens, grab power tokens equal to the amount that the action card states you have. <br/>
      <li>After a barrier block is removed by demolition, return the barrier token to the setup area. <br/>
      <li>You cannot move to a square another piece occupies unless you have more power than that player, if you do, the other player has to place their piece back at spawn. <br/>
      <li>If another player has pieces that occupy the middle, whoever has the least power has to send their pieces back to spawn. <br/>
      <li>Each piece that occupies the middle earns you 2 points per turn. <br/>
      <li>The first player that achieves 40 points wins. <br/> 
      <li>After a player has won, second place goes to the player besides the winner with the most points. <br/>
      </ol>
    <p>
      <b>Winning</b>
      <br/><br/>
      The winner goes to the first person that has 40 points, since only 1 color can be in the center at one time, there cannot be a tie. Second place goes to the player with the most power, besides the winner.
