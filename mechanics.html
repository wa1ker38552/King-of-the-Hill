King of the Hill is mostly strategy based on only portions of it are random or based on luck. Some aspects that are random are the card drawing mechanics which allow you to draw the top card of the deck based on the amount of pieces you have on your spawn. This spawn/card rule is implemented so that the player needs to strategize on whether or not to attack the center first or stock up on resources gained from farming at the spawn. If the player decides to move their pieces forward, they might not have enough resources to continue going forward or fight off an attack and have to restart at spawn. On the other hand, if a player leaves all their pieces at spawn to farm cards, they might lose the game since another player that balances farming and attacking could win first. A basic strategy for balancing farming and attacking could be that you have 2 pieces that advance while 2 stay behind to farm and collect cards. This way, players could gain 2 cards every turn while still being able to move their pieces and gain points from occupying the center. 
      <br/><br/>
      There are 125 cards you can draw from the deck, 20 movement cards, 20 power 1 cards, 15 power 5 cards, 10 power 10 cards, 5 power 25 cards, 5 extra turn cards, 20 barrier cards, and 30 demolition cards. Your chances of drawing higher level power cards decrease the higher the level of the power card is. Your chances of drawing a power 1 card is significantly higher than your chances of drawing a power 25 card. 16% to 4%. The card that appears most in the deck are the demolition cards which are used to demolish barricades along the way. The reason there are 30 demolition cards and only 20 barrier cards is that the board naturally starts off with 12 barrier blocks surrounding the center of the board so that technically brings the total amount of barrier cards to 32. The cards with the lowest probability of being drawn are the power 25 cards and the extra turn cards which each have a 4% chance of being drawn. Since these cards are more powerful and could be used to give the player more advantage, there are less of them in the deck to balance out the game. Since all the power cards in the deck add up to 320 power (80 power for each player on average), there are only 320 power tokens in the setup. 
      <br/><br/>
      When playing with only 2 players, rather than playing with the 4 player rules, the players could decide if they want to control 2 armies each instead of each commanding one and fighting for the center. This would increase the speed of the game since players could leave behind an army to farm for cards while another army could advance to the center. If both players decide to apply this strategy, the person with higher power would win which would make the outcome based on luck. Playing with 2 players in this style would also decrease the amount of time needed to win the game by occupying the center since you gain 2 points for each player occupied in the center. If you have both armies at the center, you gain 16 points a turn which would allow you to win the game in a mere 3 turns after control. There are 157 point tokens included in the game which is the max amount of tokens players could have in any given situation. The scenario that requires the most tokens would be if 3 players were 1 point away from winning (39) and 1 player won (40) which would equal to a total of 157 tokens which is why 157 tokens are included in the game.
